Grunt: Not Just for Non-Communicators Anymore
---------------------------------------------
_A brief introduction to Grunt_

What is Grunt
-------------
Grunt is a node.js powered task runner.

What does that even *mean*?

[role="incremental"]
Grunt makes you more productive and less stressed.


More about Grunt
----------------
Grunt fills approximately the same role as `make`, `rake`, `gradle`, and 
`maven` in other development environments. 

However, Grunt is based on node and fits into a JavaScript based workflow
with fewer moving parts and dependencies to keep in sync.


How will Grunt help me
----------------------
Grunt helps you:

[role="incremental"]
* Automate your workflow
* Bring together best of class tools to improve how you create applications
* Put your tasks into an independant, versionable container


Getting started with Grunt
--------------------------
Grunt needs several things to get started.  

1.  node.js: It is node.js powered after all.
2.  `package.json`: This file contains information about your project and
    contains a list of the Grunt modules that you'll use to make things 
    work.
3.  `Gruntfile.js`: This is the file that configures the modules from the 
    `package.json` file and defines your tasks.

Once those are all assembled, you can run `grunt` and fire off various tasks
for your project.


Some common Grunt tasks
-----------------------

Here are some common tasks that Grunt helps automate and gets all of these 
tasks out of your hair.

[role="incremental"]
* Compile Sass/SCSS/less
* Concatenate JavaScript files
* Minify CSS stylesheets
* Uglify JavaScript files
* Run lint-ers for JavaScript/CSS files


Maybe a little less mundane
---------------------------
But Grunt isn't just limited to JavaScript and CSS files.

Grunt can help with:

[role="incremental"]
* Configure and run unit and integration tests
* Build projects in a 'src' to 'dist' fashion
* Livereload the browser
* Watch files for changes and fire tasks based on those changes
* Start a local web server for development


How about something just a little more funky
--------------------------------------------
Grunt isn't limited to particularly web related tasks. There are plugins to
all sorts of other things such as:

[role="incremental"]
* Copy files to Amazon S3 platform
* Minify SVG graphics
* Compile Markdown documents
* Generate OS Notifications 


So how do I get in on this lazy lifestyle
-----------------------------------------
* Install `node` and `npm` (http://nodejs.org/[] for detailed instructions)
* Open a terminal or command shell and run `npm install -g grunt-cli`
* Whip up a `package.json` file such as this:
[source,javascript]
----
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "grunt": "~0.4.1",
    "grunt-contrib-uglify": "~0.2.0",
    "grunt-contrib-jshint": "~0.4.3"
  }
}
----
* Run `npm install`
* Define some grunt tasks in a `Gruntfile.js`
* Run `grunt <some task>`


"Real World" use
----------------
How fast can you get started on a website?  How about:

[role="incremental"]
1.  `git clone https://github.com/lafent/grunt-and-done.git`
2.  `cd grunt-and-done && npm install`
3.  `grunt`

[role="incremental"]
Now you have Twitter Bootstrap v3, jQuery, Google Analytics, less 
stylesheets, Jade html templating. a local web server, and a watch task to 
updating the output files upon save.  

[role="incremental"]
*Not bad for three commands.*


A word of caution
-----------------
Careful with the plugins.  There are plugins, then there are "plugins". 
Strictly speaking this problem is more properly with the node.js ecosystem, but
the rapid rate of development, general flexibility, and somewhat ambiguous
quality of some of the plugins and modules can have some unpleasant side
effects. 

*Always practice safe computing.*


Closing
-------
Thanks, that's all folks!
